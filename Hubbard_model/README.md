To run the code download Package.wl and Main.wl on the same folder. Open Main.wl, you will find 4 cells that you have to run one after the other:

- the first cell calls all the functions stored in Package.wl;

- the second cell is the input cell, where you can modify all the input parameters as you wish;

- the third cell runs the DMFT loop: you need not modify anything here;

- the last one computes the observables: you can modify adding more plots if you need to.


Use Main_Full_Run.wl in place of Main.wl to run the code for a set of chosen values of the interaction U.
